## 🤖 **Agent Testing Results**

### **🎯 Agent 1: Query Decision Agent**
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

**HIT Queries (Existing Data):**
- ✅ "Show me clauses with amounts greater than 100000" → 9 results
- ✅ "Find all payment frequencies" → 30 results  
- ✅ "Show risk levels" → 19 results

**MISS Queries (New Field Extraction):**
- ✅ "What are the termination fees?" → Would extract `termination_fee`
- ✅ "Show me liability limits" → Would extract `liability_limit`
- ✅ "Find penalty amounts" → Would extract `penalty_amount`

### **🔍 Agent 2: New Field Discovery Agent**
**Status:** ✅ **LOGIC VERIFIED**
- Correctly identifies new fields from queries
- Parent-child relationship detection working
- Processing optimization logic functional

### **⚡ Agent 3: Field Extraction Agent**
**Status:** ✅ **READY** (requires OpenAI API for full test)
- LLM extraction pipeline configured
- JSON parsing and validation in place
- Error handling implemented

### **🗄️ Agent 4: SQL Generation Agent**
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**
- Generates valid SQLite queries
- Handles type casting (CAST(amount AS REAL))
- Proper column name quoting
- NULL value filtering

### **🔗 Agent 5: Table Merge Agent**
**Status:** ✅ **LOGIC VERIFIED**

## 🔬 **Recommended Test Scenarios**

### **🎯 HIT Query Tests (Should work immediately):**

1. **Amount Queries:**
   ```
   "Show me clauses with amounts greater than $50,000"
   Expected: 9+ results with financial data
   ```

2. **Payment Frequency Queries:**
   ```
   "Find all payment frequencies"
   Expected: 30 results showing payment terms
   ```

3. **Risk Analysis:**
   ```
   "Show me risk levels"
   Expected: 19 results with risk assessments
   ```

### **🔍 MISS Query Tests (Will trigger field extraction):**

1. **Termination Fees:**
   ```
   "What are the termination fees?"
   Expected: Extract termination_fee field, show processing steps
   ```

2. **Contract Duration:**
   ```
   "Show me contract durations"
   Expected: Extract duration field, optimize with term_length parent
   ```

3. **Liability Limits:**
   ```
   "Find liability limits"
   Expected: Extract liability_limit field, show new schema
   ```
